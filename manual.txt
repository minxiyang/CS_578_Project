1. Neural Network
    python neural_network.py
    Comment line 680-689 to avoid running experiments with different training sample size to save time.

2. SVM
    Langauge: Python3.7

    Command to run:
    Since hyperparameter tuning takes hours, there is a way to skip it.
    (1) Running without hyperparameter tuning (gamma = 0.01, C = 100)
        python3 svm.py 1
    (2) Running with hyperparameter tuning
        python3 svm.py 0

3. Adaptive Boosted Decision Tree
